### Question

Write 2 algo

Algo 1: 
x**n = x*(x**(n-1))

Algo 2:
n = 2**m
X**n = ((X**2) **2) **2â€¦, etc.
[NOTE: the symbol of power (**) is used m times here, i.e., X**8 = ((X**2) **2) **2, because 8 = 2**3].

We have to find which Algo will run faster and why?

### Answer

Algo 2 will take lesser time, since it will perform less iteration than algo 1. 
For same power, Algo 2 will perform 3 steps whereas Algo 1 will perform 8 steps.
